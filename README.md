#GoCD Demo

A simple setup to bring up a GoCD server with 2 agents. 
This includes a config file which has a typical value stream configured which would help explain some of the concepts in GoCD.
Some users with varied roles and permissions are setup, check `<roles>` section in the config file for the exact details.
